# Cancer-Type-Prediction-and-Exploration-of-TCGA-Data

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify cancer subtypes using gene expression data. Leveraging datasets from the TCGA Pan Cancer analysis project and the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we strive to create a robust system for accurate prediction of cancer subtypes.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection:** Aggregate gene expression data from TCGA Pan Cancer project and UCI Repository.
- **Preprocessing:** Clean and integrate data for effective model training.
- **Model Development:** Utilize supervised learning techniques for model creation.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance to ensure robustness and generalizability.
- **Deployment:** Implement the trained model in a production environment.

## Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The primary dataset is sourced from the TCGA Pan Cancer analysis project, with additional data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to enhance model performance.
you can find the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq
## Deliverables
- **Source Code:** Available on GitHub.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Illustrate the analysis and model training process.
- **Model Artifacts:** Trained models ready for deployment.
- **Documentation:** Detailed project documentation for replication and further development.
